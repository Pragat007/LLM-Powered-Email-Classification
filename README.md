# LLM-Powered-Email-Classification
A proof-of-concept application to intelligently process email order requests and customer inquiries using GPT-4

## Features
- **Email Classification**: Automatically classify emails as product inquiries or order requests.
- **Order Processing**: Check product availability, update stock levels, and generate order statuses.
- **Response Generation**: Create production-ready email responses for both orders and inquiries.

## Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Pragat007/LLM-Powered-Email-Classification.git`
2. Add Google Spreadsheet with products and emails.
3. Run the main script to start code.

## Usage
After setting up, run the main script to classify emails, process orders, and generate responses. The results will be saved in the provided spreadsheet in separate sheets.

5. **Limited Contextual Understanding**
   - **Complex Queries**: May struggle with context-rich queries or multi-step reasoning.
   - **Context Retention**: Limited ability to retain context across multiple emails.

6. **Security and Privacy Concerns**
   - **Data Privacy**: Potential privacy concerns with handling sensitive customer data.
   - **API Key Exposure**: Risk of unauthorized usage if API keys are not securely managed.

7. **Customization and Adaptability**
   - **Limited Custom Responses**: May not always match the level of personalization needed.
   - **Adaptation to Business Needs**: Fine-tuning may be required for specific business requirements.

8. **Maintenance and Updates**
   - **Model Drift**: Continuous monitoring and updating are necessary to maintain performance.
   - **Dependency on External Data Sources**: Reliance on external sources may affect functionality if disrupted.


## API Usage
The project leverages the OpenAI GPT-4 API for natural language processing tasks. Make sure to set your API key in the environment variables or directly in the script.
